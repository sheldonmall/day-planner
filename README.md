My website is simple to use. 

The website is fully working and I am  able to complete all requirements. At first, I struggled to display the HTML page correctly and displaying saved tasks from the local storage due to my logic, but got review and help from my TA. 

I will continue to improve the code work after this assignment is submitted.
